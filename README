1. Introduction

uninno is a portable unpacking tool for Inno Setup (IS) installers.

Inno Setup is a popular tool for creating software package installers for the
Microsoft Windows operating system. It was written in Delphi by Jordan Russell
and released under an open source licence.

Other unpacking tools exist, but they are based on the original Inno Setup
source code. As the main intended target platform for such installers is
Windows, not much effort has been made to make unpackers portable to other
operating systems.

There are however cases, where there is a legitimate motivation to extract the
installable files on other platforms: One such example is the redistribution of
older software, for which alternative or ported versions exist, but do not
include required data files, as those are covered by a different copyright. See
the links for (legal) distributors of such software.

The data extraction routines are loosely based on the Inno Setup source code,
but entirely rewritten due to large differences in programming languages and
to improve portability. Some data structures may be reproduced in comments to
help with reimplementation. These will be removed when implementation and
testing is complete.
See http://www.jrsoftware.org/files/is/license.txt for the Inno Setup license.


3. Usage

At its current stage, uninno is provided mainly as a library for dissecting
and analyzing Inno Setup installers. For quick-and-dirty extraction, run
the extract.pl tool on your installer:

$ ./extract.pl setup.exe

Output will be sent to /tmp/uninno.


4. Development

uninno consists of a bunch of Perl packages that handle different stages of the
analysis and extractiong process. Dissection of the installer executable is
provided by Win::Exe, which has some submodules for each of the PE's parts.
Setup::Inno provides a frontend for parsing the setup.0 (metadata) and setup.1
(compressed files) parts of the Inno Setup installer.

To improve code reuse and facilitate handling of all the installer versions,
all version-specific code is represented in a (linear) class hierarchy, spanning
from a base class with simple code stubs over the first open source Inno Setup
release (2.0.8) up to the most recent version. Each class in the hierarchy has
override points that implement data structures, decompression and custom
handling required for this version or its descendants.

TODO: Provide a helper that walks the hierarchy and finds override points.
